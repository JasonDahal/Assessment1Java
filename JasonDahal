Pseudo code:
Algorithm - first
1. Start.
2. Instantiating a variable name highestMark with datatype Double.
	Double highestMark = unitMarks.get(0);
3. Similarly, instantiating another variable name lowestMark with datatype Double.
	Double lowestMark = unitMarks.get(0);
4. Using do-while loop for the iteration:
	 do {
            Double userMarks = sc.nextDouble();
            if (userMarks > 0 && userMarks < 100) {
                unitMarks.add(userMarks);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Please input the marks between 0 and 100");
            }
        } while (unitMarks.size() != 25);
5. Iterating the value to get the highest and lowests marks using for loop ends after this.
6. Displaying the highest and lowest marks obtained by students from their respective units.
7. Stop.

Algorithm - second
1. Start.
2. Instantiating a variable named calculate with double value 0.0.
	Double calculate = 0.0;
3. Using for loop for the iteration:
	for (int i=0; i < unitMarks.size(); i ++) {
            calculate += unitMarks.get(i);
        }
4. Writing the logic of mean.
	        double meanCalculate = calculate / unitMarks.size();
5. Displaying the calculated mean.
6. Instantiating a variable summationstd of datatype double.
	        double summationStd = 0.0;
7. Using for loop for iterating over unit marks to get the value which is the product of (unitmarks obtained subtracted with the calculated mean above).
	 for (int i = 0; i < unitMarks.size(); i++) {    
            double someValue = Math.pow((unitMarks.get(i) - meanCalculate), 2);
            summationStd += someValue;
        }
8. Now, again using various different logic as per the formula of standard deviation.
	int divisorValue = unitMarks.size() - 1;             
        double someValue = summationStd / divisorValue;
        double stDeviation = Math.pow(someValue, 0.5);

9. Finally, displaying the standard deviation.
10. Stop.
